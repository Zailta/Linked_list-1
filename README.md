## Link − Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.

## Next − Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.

## LinkedList − A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First.

# Types of Linked List

## Simple Linked List − Item navigation is forward only.

## Doubly Linked List − Items can be navigated forward and backward.

## Circular Linked List − Last item contains link of the first element as next and the first element has a link to the last element as previous.

This C++ program shows the simple implementation of a Linked list through:
## Creation, deletion, Insertion, Sorting and Reversing of a Linked List
